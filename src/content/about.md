I’m a product engineer with a backend-first focus, building real systems from idea to production. I enjoy turning rough ideas into usable software, making early architecture decisions that hold up, and shipping things that stay reliable in production.

My default mode is pragmatic engineering: clear boundaries, maintainability over cleverness, and simplicity over fragile complexity. I’m comfortable owning the infrastructure around what I build, including CI/CD, deployments, and production operations, because reliability is part of the product.

I work across stacks and adapt quickly when the product demands it, with experience in Swift, TypeScript, Python, and Java. I’m looking for product-focused roles in small to mid-sized teams with high ownership and close product collaboration, with room to grow architecture responsibility over time. I transitioned from Economics to Computer Science, and I bring that analytical background into how I reason about systems and tradeoffs.
