Have an idea you’d like to explore? A rough concept, a half-formed product, or something you’re not quite sure how to approach yet?

I’m happy to jump on a call and help you think it through.

This is a lightweight starting point for collaboration. No rigid scope, no pressure to turn it into a full project. Just a focused conversation to clarify direction, feasibility, and next steps.
