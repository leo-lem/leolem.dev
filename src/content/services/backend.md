Want a backend that just works?  
I’ll build a clean, production-ready cloud backend using Firebase (or an equivalent stack) and connect it to your app or web frontend.  
You’ll get a fast, secure, and scalable setup that’s easy to extend later.

Perfect for founders and small teams who need a working foundation instead of boilerplate.

**What you will get**
- Authentication and database setup
- Cloud storage and hosting configuration
- Secure rules and environment setup
- Optional frontend connection (Next, React, SwiftUI, etc.)
- Documentation and project handover
