Want a lightweight but polished iOS app? I’ll build a SwiftUI MVP — ideal for early-stage products, personal tools, or habit trackers.

**What’s included:**
- SwiftUI UI with MVVM
- Optional Core Data or SwiftData storage
- Smooth animations and haptics
- Clean, modular codebase
- Built for iOS 15+

Perfect for rapid testing, internal tools, or App Store prototypes.
