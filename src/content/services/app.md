Want a lightweight but polished iOS app? I’ll build a SwiftUI MVP — ideal for early-stage products, personal tools, or habit trackers. You can choose between local storage (e.g. Core Data) or a Firebase backend (Firestore, Auth, Remote Config).

**What’s included:**
- SwiftUI UI with MVVM
- Optional local (Core Data / SwiftData) or Firebase backend
- Smooth animations and haptics
- Clean, modular codebase
- Built for iOS 15+

Perfect for rapid testing, internal tools, or App Store prototypes.
