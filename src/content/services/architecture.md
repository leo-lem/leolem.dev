Need a solid foundation before building your app?  
I’ll design and set up a clean, scalable architecture for your web or mobile project.  
The result is a maintainable codebase, clear environment structure, and ready-to-use CI/CD setup your team can confidently build on.

Ideal for startups or teams who want to start right without reworking everything later.

**What you will get**
- Architecture and environment setup (frontend + backend)
- Clean folder structure and dependencies
- Example feature wired from backend to UI
- CI/CD pipeline integration
- Documentation and project handover
