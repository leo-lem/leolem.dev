leolem.dev is my personal website and portfolio â€” fast, clean, and fully static. It's built with [Astro](https://astro.build), styled with TailwindCSS, and deployed via GitHub Pages.

The site features projects, blog articles, a services page, and is optimized for both content and performance. A collapsible mobile nav and custom theme make the site usable across devices and easy on the eyes.

### My Contributions

1. Designed the structure and layout for a clean personal presence
2. Built the site using Astro with full Markdown/MDX support
3. Styled components with TailwindCSS and custom dark/light theming
4. Added GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline for seamless deploys
5. Integrated blog and project collections via Astro Content Collections
6. Authored blog articles and built a custom layout system
