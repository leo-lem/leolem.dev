StudentScroll is a full-stack web application designed to serve as a social platform for university students. It enables users to create and interact with posts, follow fellow students, participate in discussions, and chat in real time.

Developed as part of a group project during a semester abroad at AUT (Auckland University of Technology), the application was built with a React frontend and Spring Boot backend. The frontend uses modern practices like component composition and responsive design, while the backend exposes a REST API with JWT authentication, pagination, and real-time chat functionality powered by WebSockets.

### My Contributions

1. Acted as Technical Lead, managing code quality and development coordination across the five-person team.
2. Implemented major backend features, including authentication, real-time messaging, and API endpoint design.
3. Built reusable frontend components in React and helped integrate the API with the frontend.
4. Oversaw the CI/CD setup and ensured deployment readiness during project sprints.
5. Participated in Agile planning, rotating through roles like Product Owner and Scrum Master to simulate team dynamics in real-world development.
