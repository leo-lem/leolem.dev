This project analyzes public sentiment on climate change using NLP techniques on social media data from Twitter, YouTube, and Bluesky. Fine-tuned BERT models classify sentiment trends and correlate them with real-world events. The study includes data preprocessing, web scraping, and visualization to provide actionable insights for effective communication strategies in climate advocacy.

### My Contributions

1. Fine-tuned a non-sentiment BERT model for climate change-related text classification.
2. Configured training parameters and managed large-scale data preprocessing to ensure model adaptability.
3. Benchmarked the performance of a non-sentiment-focused approach against sentiment-optimized models.
4. Collaborated on implementing visualizations that improved the project's overall accuracy and reproducibility.
