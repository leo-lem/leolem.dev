I am turning 25 soon, and that feels like a good moment to look back. I often get caught up in what I have not done yet, or I compare myself to other people and feel behind. But the truth is, I have come a long way already. I just do not always take the time to notice it. Writing this is my way of becoming more conscious of what I have achieved, so I can build some confidence from it instead of always chasing the next thing.

## Milestone 1: Drums (2011)

When I was 11 I started playing drums. For years it was my main passion. I even thought about making it a career, but I realized it would take a lifestyle that does not really fit me. Still, I got to a decent level, and later on I also picked up guitar. Guitar is more what I have played in the last few years, even though I have not practiced much recently. Music is not my main focus anymore, but it is something I can always fall back to and enjoy.

## Milestone 2: Surviving school (2016–2018)

The last years of school were not great for me. I struggled and honestly just wanted it to be over. But I pushed through and got my Abitur. Looking back, it was less about the grades and more about proving to myself that I could make it through a tough stretch.

## Milestone 3: The in-between year (2018–2019)

After school I did not jump straight into university. I worked at my godfather’s place on Rügen, traveled a bit, lived with my grandparents for a while, and worked for my dad. I also gave music one more serious try. In the end it was a year of searching, trying things, and figuring out what I did not want.

## Milestone 4: Economics in Freiburg (2019–2021)

I moved to Freiburg to study economics. For the first time I was living on my own and managing myself. Then Covid hit. While it was tough socially, it gave me space to focus on studying. I ended up finishing my Bachelor’s in just two years with a 1.2 average. That was the first time I realized I could really perform at a high level academically.

## Milestone 5: Discovering coding

During those Covid years I started programming. I built my first apps, *Smokes* and *KeepinOn*. They were not perfect, but they were mine, and they got me hooked. That is when I knew I wanted to move toward software.

## Milestone 6: First job in IT (2022)

I worked at MaibornWolff for most of the year. That was my first real job in the IT world and it gave me a taste of the kind of work I wanted to be doing long term.

## Milestone 7: New Zealand (2023)

In early 2023 I went to New Zealand for an exchange semester. It shaped me in a lot of ways. I traveled, had to adapt socially, and I even published my first app internationally.

## Milestone 8: The crazy autumn (late 2023)

When I came back, life sped up. I partied, took my motorcycle up to Norway, and at the same time started catching up on computer science courses at Uni Hamburg. I also started working at Capgemini and met my girlfriend. A lot happened in just a few months.

## Milestone 9: Master’s and running (2024)

In autumn 2024 I officially started my Master’s in computer science. Around the same time I got serious about running. I ran a full marathon, a 38 km trail run with 2400 m of climbing, a 10k under 50 minutes, and a half marathon under two hours. Building physical endurance became a big part of my growth.

## Milestone 10: Finland (2025)

Right now I am in Jyväskylä for my exchange semester. I joined a Finnish course and a language club because I want to prove to myself that I can really learn a new language. I am also thinking about writing my thesis from here. On top of that I landed my first freelance job, got paid decently for it, and I am still building my own projects, *Almost?*, *Anagrams*, and my website.

Looking back at these milestones makes me realize that progress does not only come in leaps. A lot of it has been slow, sometimes even invisible while I was in the middle of it. But stacked together these years tell a story I can be proud of. That gives me confidence for the next ones still to come.
