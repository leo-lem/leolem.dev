title: Switching Into Vacation Mode
short: A short reflection on slowing down without dropping my routines over the holidays

This year's Christmas break started the moment I left Jyväskylä. After a fast exchange semester, it felt strange to suddenly step out of the rhythm I had built over months. Instead of going straight home, I spent about two weeks in Lapland, followed by Christmas in Munich, a few intense days with friends, and New Year’s before everything finally came to a stop.

What surprised me most was not where I went or who I saw, but how well a new approach to “vacation mode” worked for me.

## Leaving exchange mode

The exchange semester had been dense. New city, new language, independent courses, freelance work on the side. Everything moved quickly and demanded attention. When I left Jyväskylä, there was no clean break, just a gradual shift into something slower.

Lapland helped with that. The days were quieter, darker, colder. I stayed in familiar settings with familiar people, which removed a lot of friction. There was space to think without needing to be productive.

## Dialing habits down, not off

In the past, holidays often meant dropping routines entirely. This time I tried something different. Instead of stopping my habits, I scaled them down.

I kept my Finnish review going, but capped it at around twenty five minutes. I continued journaling, but without any pressure to write something meaningful. I stuck to a simple diet rule of one proper protein meal a day and let everything else be flexible.

None of this was about discipline. It was about continuity. Keeping a light version of my routines made it easier to stay grounded without turning the break into another project.

## Lapland, then family

The break itself was socially full but emotionally calmer than expected. Lapland was split across different settings, but the overall pace stayed slow. Walks, quiet evenings, simple days.

Christmas in Munich was the opposite in structure but similar in effect. Family rhythms are familiar and predictable. There was no need to optimize anything. Just showing up was enough.

What mattered was that I did not try to “use” the time. I did not plan improvements or resets. I just let the days pass with a bit of structure underneath.

## Ending the year with people

After that came a few dense days of meeting friends. Catching up, conversations, shared meals, late evenings. New Year’s marked the end of the break and the return of momentum.

By then, I noticed something had shifted. I did not feel like I was restarting from zero. The habits I cared about were still there, just quieter.

## What stuck with me

This break taught me that rest does not have to mean chaos. Scaling routines down worked far better than dropping them completely. It reduced the friction of getting back into daily life and kept my energy more even throughout the holidays.

I am taking that idea with me into the new year. Not everything needs to be all or nothing. Sometimes it is enough to keep things alive at a lower volume.

It was a good break. Calm, social, and grounding. Exactly what I needed after a fast semester and before the next chapter begins.
