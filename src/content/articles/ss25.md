## A Different Approach to Studying

I used to be able to spend hours grinding through boring material. But I’ve come to approach studying differently. I actually want to take something from the courses I take. No one is forcing me to be here, so I might as well make the most of it. This semester, I tried to embrace that mindset more seriously. It’s a great opportunity to dive deeper into topics I might otherwise gloss over.

## Master Thesis and Future Plans

I spent some time exploring master thesis topics. There’s a lot of fast-paced development happening in this space, so I decided to postpone starting until January. That way, I can focus on doing it right. I’m aiming to build something meaningful.

## Academic Load and Tools

Last semester was packed: five exams and a project, 39 credits total. It was too much to really enjoy any of it. I relied a lot more on ChatGPT this time. Sometimes the explanations felt shallow, but overall it helped me study more actively and engage with the material. We'll see how it pays off.

## Building, Not Just Studying

Despite the workload, I started early and carved out time for other things. I launched a new app, built my personal webpage, and began shaping my online presence. That balance made the semester feel more worthwhile.

## What Comes Next

The exchange semester starts Sunday. I don’t need the credits anymore, so I’ll be exploring freelancing, meeting new people, and enjoying the freedom. I’m ready for a new step—toward more independent work, and eventually, founding something of my own.
