## Arriving and diving in

The first few weeks here were a rush. I landed in Jyväskylä ready to make the most of it, and I did. I joined the Finnish course, went to every event I could find, and met more people in those first three weeks than I expected to in three months. Our language class turned into a close group quickly, and most days felt full from morning to night. I wanted to connect early, to throw myself into it all before the usual hesitation could catch up. It worked, but it also drained me more than I realized.

## Slowing down

By the end of August the energy started to fade. Our dog at home passed away, and that hit me harder than I thought it would from a distance. Around the same time I met my girlfriend in Helsinki, and even though we had a good time, I could feel how empty I’d run myself. That week was a turning point, not in any dramatic way, just the moment I realized I needed to slow down. I had pushed hard to settle in, and now I needed to find a steadier pace.

## Finding rhythm again

The weeks after were quieter. I let things breathe again, took fewer plans, and spent more time on small routines. I started going for morning runs by the lake, when the fog still hangs low and the air feels cleaner than anywhere else I’ve been. The rhythm of the water and the sound of gravel under my shoes made me feel grounded again. I got back to studying properly, wrapped up most of my courses, and started my first real freelancing project. Earning that first bit of money on my own felt great, but more than that, the work itself felt right. Building something from scratch, at my own pace, reminded me why I love what I do.

## Living more slowly

Lately I’ve been rebuilding my routines, running regularly, cooking better, and taking care of the small things that make the days feel balanced. I’ve been practising approaching people again too, just small interactions to keep stretching that comfort zone. Not with the same all-out energy as in August, but in a calmer, steadier way. It’s strange how quickly things can shift from chaos to calm once you give them space to.

## The calm around here

What I love most about Finland is the sense of space. The forests start right behind the city, and lakes cut through everything like glass. The sunsets linger, and the air turns colder now in October, the kind that wakes you up the moment you step outside. Most people around me are international, but even so, there’s something distinctly Finnish about how quiet and respectful the days feel. My runs through the forest have become my reset points. That’s where I think best, where ideas for projects or small life decisions just sort themselves out.

## Looking ahead

Two months in, I feel balanced again. Clear-headed and calm. I came here wanting change, and I got it, though not in the way I expected. It’s less about doing more and more about finding a rhythm that lasts. I don’t know yet how long I’ll stay, but for now, this feels like the right place to keep learning that balance.
