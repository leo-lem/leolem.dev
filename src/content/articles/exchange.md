My exchange in Finland has been one of those rare stretches of life where everything feels new at once. New city new language new routine new people. It started fast and never really slowed down and somehow that was exactly what I needed.

## A language as an anchor

The Finnish course became the anchor of the semester. Daily reviews the early tests and the slow realisation that the language is actually learnable. I built my deck system and kept it running every day and the feeling of understanding even a bit of Finnish in real conversations was worth the effort.

## Independent study

The rest of my studies worked in a very different way. Most courses were independent so I carried the responsibility myself. It made the semester flexible but also busy because every assignment had to be pushed forward without anyone asking for it. I had to stay organised and in the end it made me more confident working on my own.

## Freelancing on the side

Around that came my first paid freelance project which ended up shaping the semester more than I expected. It gave me a clear direction for what I want to do next and made me realise how much I enjoy building things for real clients. Balancing it with university made August and September full but also strangely satisfying. There were weeks where every day was packed yet it felt like I was moving somewhere.

## The social side

Socially the semester was easier than I thought it would be. I met people quickly and some of them became close friends. We did trips events movie nights sauna evenings and many small hangouts that filled the weeks with momentum. I learned where I feel comfortable and where I need to push myself a bit and how to stay social without burning out.

## Travel and quiet moments

I explored Jyväskylä properly and went on several small trips. The campervan journey with my friend from Germany stands out the most. Long quiet drives along forests and lakes and the kind of stillness that Finland does better than anywhere else. Later came smaller getaways like Kouvola and Rovaniemi each adding a small story to the semester.

## What stayed with me

Somewhere in all of this I learned more about myself. How I handle pressure how I manage routines how I bounce back and how much I enjoy a life where days are full but balanced. Finland made me calmer more confident and more steady. It showed me that I can build a new life quickly and enjoy it.

It has been a good semester. A busy one but a good one. And it changed me more than I expected when I first arrived.
