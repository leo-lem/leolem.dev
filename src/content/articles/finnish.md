I started learning Finnish a few months ago when my beginners course began at the university. At that point I knew almost nothing. The alphabet was familiar, but the rest felt like a wall.

## Building a routine

The only thing that helped was doing a little bit every day. I built a proper flashcard deck in Mochi and added new words whenever I could. I cleaned it up again and again until it actually became useful. It took a while to find a rhythm, but once the system was in place it made the daily practice simple.

## Bringing Finnish into everyday life

Outside the classroom I tried to place the language in places where I would naturally run into it. I watched *Luottomies* to get used to real speech. I joined tandem chats and ended up talking with a few people, most often with Lyydia who has been incredibly patient and helpful. Those conversations made the grammar and vocabulary feel less abstract and more alive.

## Small steps that add up

Our course covered basic situations like daily routines, hobbies and simple small talk. At first everything sounded strange and slow. After a while I noticed that Finnish no longer scared me. I could follow short dialogues, read signs around the city, and build simple sentences without needing to stop and plan each one.

When I look back, the progress came from mixing everything. A bit of classwork, a bit of Mochi cards, a bit of *Luottomies*, and short chats with actual Finns. None of it impressive on its own, but together it moved things in a steady way.

## Where I am now

I am still far from fluent, but the language no longer feels unreachable. It has started to slip into my everyday rhythm, and that alone feels like a good sign.
