Welcome.

I’m Leo. I’m a software engineer, currently spending most of my time between product work, systems engineering, and writing code that actually has to run in the real world.

This blog is where I collect thoughts from that process.

Sometimes that’s technical: building iOS apps, setting up CI pipelines, experimenting with infrastructure, or shipping small projects. Sometimes it’s more reflective: working independently, staying consistent, navigating transitions, or learning new things alongside everything else.

There’s no grand theme here. It’s mostly a record of what I’m building and what I’m noticing while doing it.

## Why I write

Partly for clarity.

Writing helps me slow down and make sense of what I’m working on. It turns vague ideas into something concrete and forces me to be honest about what’s actually happening beneath the surface.

Partly for continuity.

Projects come and go. Roles change. But documenting the process creates a thread through all of it. This blog is that thread.

If you care about clean software, practical systems, or the quieter side of building things, you might find something useful here.

## Staying in touch

You can follow along here via RSS, or connect with me on LinkedIn. If you’d like to talk about an idea or a potential collaboration, there’s also a contact option on the site.

No pressure. This is a slow blog.

Thanks for reading.
