Transferring my domain to [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) was a low-effort, high-impact upgrade. It gave me more control over my personal site [leolem.dev](https://leolem.dev) and significantly reduced annual costs. It also introduced better analytics and a cleaner developer experience.

Hereâ€™s how it went and what I learned.

## TL;DR

Cloudflare wins:
- âœ… Lower cost
- âœ… Cleaner DNS and email setup
- âœ… Useful free analytics
- âœ… Better control

Worth it.

## Why I Migrated

A few simple reasons:
- **Price**: Cloudflare offers domains at-cost. Iâ€™m saving **~40%** compared to Squarespace.
- **Analytics**: Cloudflare Analytics is **privacy-first and free** â€” ideal for simple personal sites.
- **Control**: Their DNS and security tools are transparent, fast, and developer-friendly.

## The Process

Moving the domain was straightforward:

1. Switched **nameservers** to Cloudflare (already done previously)
2. Unlocked the domain in Squarespace
3. Requested the **auth code**
4. Initiated transfer in Cloudflare using that code
5. Confirmed via email, then waited ~5 days

## A Few Snags

### ðŸ”’ Smoke Tests Blocked

After switching, my Playwiright smoke tests failed. Turns out **Cloudflareâ€™s Bot Fight Mode** was blocking them. Disabling the setting fixed it.

### ðŸ§­ Lost CNAMEs

Subdomain CNAME records didnâ€™t carry over automatically â€” `smokes.leolem.dev` and `launchlab.leolem.dev` both vanished. I had to re-add them manually in Cloudflare DNS.

## Bonus: Email Domain Transfer

I also migrated my **private email domain**. WHOIS and DNS now show Cloudflare, but **Squarespace still lists it as active**. Iâ€™ll give it a few days, then reach out to support and close my Squarespace account.

If you're doing the same:
- Delete any lingering Squarespace CNAMEs
- Verify setup with tools like [MXToolbox](https://mxtoolbox.com)

## Exploring Analytics

Now that the move is done, Iâ€™m testing **Google Search Console** to complement Cloudflareâ€™s analytics. Itâ€™s early, but the combo should give me better insight into search visibility and traffic â€” without compromising on speed or simplicity.
