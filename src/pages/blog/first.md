Welcome — and thanks for dropping by.

I'm Leo, a software engineer with a background in mobile development, DevOps, and backend automation. This blog is where I share what I'm learning, building, and exploring — whether it's SwiftUI prototyping, infrastructure design, or thoughts on working independently.

## Why This Blog Exists

This space is here to document projects, break down technical topics, and reflect on the process of building systems that are clean, maintainable, and useful. Articles might range from Firebase experiments to thoughts on architecture, freelancing, or shipping small tools.

If you're into clean code, thoughtful interfaces, and pragmatic engineering, you might find something here worth reading.
